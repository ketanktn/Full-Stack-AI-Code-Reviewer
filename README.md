# Full-Stack AI Code Reviewer

A full-stack web application designed to provide automated code reviews. The project integrates advanced AI-based models to analyze code and provide feedback, helping developers improve their coding practices.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive user interface for submitting code for review.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express to handle requests and serve responses. The backend processes code submissions and communicates with AI models for code review feedback.
- **AI Integration**: Uses advanced AI models to analyze code and provide insights and suggestions for improvement.
- **Real-time Code Analysis**: Provides near-instantaneous feedback on submitted code.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **AI Model**: Integration with GPT-3/4 or other advanced AI models for code analysis
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ketanktn/Full-Stack-AI-Code-
   Reviewer.git
   cd Full-Stack-AI-Code-Reviewer

2. Install the dependencies for the backend:
   ```bash
    npm install
### Running the Application Locally
1. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
  node server.js

### Open the application in your browser:
Visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.


## Usage
Submit your code through the frontend interface.

The backend processes the code and passes it to the AI model.

The AI model returns suggestions or feedback based on the code quality.

View the results in the frontend interface.
